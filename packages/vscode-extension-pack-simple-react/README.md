Visual Studio Code Extension
--

The VSCode extension itself. Features MicroEditors for some languages such as DMN and BPMN.

# Proposed user flow (work in progress)

- the user creates a DMN file.. edit and create the rules there
- close it
- then user create a NEW scesim file
- when editor open an empty scesim file.. it'll ask for the source. the user points to the DMN and then user will be guided (ie. wizard) to create the scenario to the rule
